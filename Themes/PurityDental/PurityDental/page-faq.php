               <div class="accordion-body">For optimal oral health, you should visit the dentist twice a year for preventive checkups and cleanings. With regular preventive care, we hope to protect your smile from the most common oral health problems, including tooth decay and gum disease. If we find anything during your checkup, we can treat it quickly, preventing a more serious problem from developing.

Night time oral cleaning is the most important to remove all the food and contaminants built up during the day. This prevents bacteria from sitting on your teeth all night which can lead to rapid decay.

We also recommend that you have a balanced diet and minimise on foods high in sugar or carbohydrates, and foods that are acidic or that will contribute to staining.

After your initial examination, the dentist will customise a treatment plan for you and then you have the choice as to how you would like to spread out your appointments to fit within your budget and schedule.

We can do immediate on-the-spot insurance claims via HICAPS. We require payment on the day of treatment and accept payments for dental services by cash, EFTPOS, Mastercard, Visa or AMEX.

We also accept payments made by internet banking if prior arrangements have been made with one of our front office co-ordinators.

               <div class="accordion-body">We accept all Private Health Insurance funds.

However if you are considering joining a private health insurance for dental treatment, it is important to weigh the cost of insurance premiums against the benefits you’ll receive. In most cases, patients will be paying the monthly premium as well as the gap for the treatment.

Usually there is an annual limit to the benefits, and if they are not used in one year, they will not carry to the following year. So if you do have health insurance, and want a check up and clean done, use it before you lose it!

For certain treatments, waiting periods can apply, so you’ll be paying a premium for a while before you can make a claim.

Sometimes delaying dental treatment until your insurance rebate kicks in have led to dental problems worsening resulting in more extensive and costly treatment.

Please call us on 9540 8900 for further information and details.
